An app that I would be interested in building would be a dictionary app. An app that can provide a definition and or example of the word inputted. Specifically, I like the idea of redesigning the "Urban Dictionary" app which is currently not the best. I like the idea of providing definitions to slang terms, it would be very interesting to build an app like that.

## Notes

The instructions were straight forward and clear. The most time consuming part was exploring Xcode and learning how to navigate it.
